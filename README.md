## Extensions

Extensions allow the community to add new music sources and features without waiting for app updates. When a streaming service API changes or a new source becomes available, extensions can be updated independently.

### Installing Extensions
1. Go to **Store** tab in the app
2. Browse and install extensions with one tap
3. Or download a `.spotiflac-ext` file and install manually via **Settings > Extensions**
4. Configure extension settings if needed
5. Set provider priority in **Settings > Extensions > Provider Priority**

### Developing Extensions

## FAQ

**Q: Why is my download failing with "Song not found"?**  
A: The track may not be available on Tidal, Qobuz, or Amazon Music. Try enabling more download services in Settings > Download > Provider Priority, or install additional extensions from the Store.

**Q: Why are some tracks downloading in lower quality?**  
A: Quality depends on what's available from the streaming service. Tidal offers up to 24-bit/192kHz, Qobuz up to 24-bit/192kHz, and Amazon up to 24-bit/48kHz. The app automatically selects the best available quality.

**Q: Can I download playlists?**  
A: Yes! Just paste the playlist URL in the search bar. The app will fetch all tracks and queue them for download.

**Q: Why do I need to grant storage permission?**  
A: The app needs permission to save downloaded files to your device. On Android 13+, you may need to grant "All files access" in Settings > Apps > SpotiFLAC > Permissions.

**Q: Is this app safe?**  
A: Yes, the app is open source and you can verify the code yourself. Each release is scanned with VirusTotal (see badge at top of README).

**Q: Why is download not working in my country?**  
A: Some countries have restricted access to certain streaming service APIs. If downloads are failing, try using a VPN to connect through a different region.
