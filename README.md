## Metadata Source

SpotiFLAC supports two metadata sources for searching tracks:

| Source | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Deezer** (Default) | No developer account needed, rate limit per user IP | Slightly less comprehensive catalog |
| **Spotify** | More comprehensive catalog, better search results | Requires developer API credentials to avoid rate limiting |
